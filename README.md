# SQL-library-manager
 Project 10 for the Web Dev. Tech Degree.

Before starting the app, run 'npm install' in the terminal. This app uses "cookie-parser", "debug", "express", "http-errors", "morgan", "pug","sequelize", "sequelize-cli", and "sqlite3".

Once all dependencies have been installed, run 'npm start' in the terminal.

Then, navigate your browser to 'localhost:3000' to view the app.

Currently, the app wipes the database each time it is started. To stop this from happening, delete or comment out the code in app.js on lines 20-26.
